h1. Installation

@python-tickit@ requires the following:

* "tickit":http://home.leonerd.org.uk/code/libtickit/ via "bzr":http://bazaar.leonerd.org.uk/c/libtickit/, revision 145 or newer.
* "Python 3.2":http://www.python.org or higher.

Additionally, if you wish to assist in developing @python-tickit@, you will also need:

* "@python-ctypeslib@":http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ctypeslib/ and
* "GCC-XML":http://www.gccxml.org/HTML/Index.html. (needed by @python-ctypeslib@)

In particular, @h2xml@ and @xml2py@ (provided by @python-ctypeslib@) are used to generate @tickit._tickit@ to avoid errors caused by manual generation of e.g. enums.

h1. Usage

@python-tickit@ mirrors the Perl "Tickit":https://metacpan.org/module/Tickit APIs where possible. The following APIs are mirrored:

* "Tickit::Pen":https://metacpan.org/module/Tickit::Pen, as a MutableMapping subclass;
* "Tickit::Rect":https://metacpan.org/module/Tickit::Rect, as a Container subclass;
* "Tickit::StringPos":https://metacpan.org/module/Tickit::StringPos; and
* "Tickit::Term":https://metacpan.org/module/Tickit::Term.

Please refer to the relevant "@collections.abc@:"http://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html documentation for Python ABC subclasses.
